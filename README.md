# DGAN-CAPTCHA

Overview
This project aims to create a model that generates captchas challenging for robots or captcha-reading models to decipher while maintaining readability for humans. The model has achieved a 68% accuracy in generating tough captchas and a 70% success rate in evading generic text recognition models. Using a Deep Conditional Generative Adversarial Network and the captcha dataset [yzm](https://github.com/aceimnorstuvwxz/captcha-dataset/blob/master/yzm1.tar.gz), it produces unique captchas effective against automated reading tools.
